                    This website's sole purpose is to modernly and eloquently
                    express my love for you through poetry in a digital way.
                    Within these pages, poems are made from my profound love for you.

                    There were times when showing my love for you is so hard, those 
                    times drove me to the idea of making a digital poem monument for you; 
                    immortalizing you through the internet.
                    Since I am studying web development, and I am under the course of
                    Computer Science, I decided to make this website.

                I knew you were the one when I saw myself better with you 
                than I am with myself. You are the color I want to paint 
                myself with, the coffee I’d look for each morning, 
                the song I’d play on repeat, the taste my lips long for, 
                the beauty my eyes seek to forevermore gaze. 
                You are everything to me. I am yours, always. 
                My heart that burns only for you, will never extinguish,
                my love for you that will forever remain an ember; 
                scorching.
